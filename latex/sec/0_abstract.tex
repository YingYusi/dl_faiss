\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a text plagiarism detection method based on FAISS and SentenceTransformer, aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of plagiarism detection. Our approach not only identifies plagiarism but also accurately pinpoints plagiarized sections, including direct quotations, paraphrasing, or disguised content. Experimental results demonstrate that this method performs well in terms of accuracy and efficiency on large-scale datasets, providing educational institutions with a more comprehensive tool for academic integrity detection, thereby contributing to the fairness and integrity of the academic environment.
