Traditional plagiarism detection methods often rely on text matching algorithms, which determine similarity by directly comparing textual content. While these methods perform well in identifying simple text reuse, they also have certain limitations. For instance, existing methods typically provide an overall similarity score but fail to pinpoint specific plagiarized sections. To address these issues, we plan to enhance the algorithm based on FAISS and REPLUG. FAISS is an efficient similarity search and clustering tool capable of identifying explicitly plagiarized text. REPLUG, on the other hand, is a retrieval-augmented language modeling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any existing retrieval or language model. By leveraging certain parameters of FAISS, we aim to address the shortcomings of current models and propose improvements.
