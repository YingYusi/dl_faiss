\section{Data description}
Our data comes from GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and some manually created data, all of which are text data. The data is divided into three categories: non-plagiarized text data, explicitly plagiarized text data, and implicitly plagiarized text data. Each category contains between 100 and 500 sentences, and they are further divided into original text data and test text data, with each original text data corresponding to a segment of test text data. For simplicity and ease of code implementation, each text segment contains no more than four sentences. Experiments have shown that this scale of data is sufficient to meet the basic requirements for plagiarism detection.
